Extreme Value Machine in Java

[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/dwicke/evm.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#dwicke/evm)

A Java 9 implementation of the Extreme Value Machine (EVM), an open world classification algorithm.

The main paper is here: https://www.wjscheirer.com/papers/wjs_tpami2017_evm.pdf (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932895)

The suplemental material and algorithm psuedo code is here: https://www.wjscheirer.com/papers/wjs_tpami2017_evm_supp.pdf

I am not the author of the paper and as far as I could tell at the time there were no public implementations. So, this is my interpretation of their algorithm.
